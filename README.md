# go-simpleflake

64-bit, roughly-ordered, unique ID generator in Go. Inspired by [this article](http://engineering.custommade.com/simpleflake-distributed-id-generation-for-the-lazy/) and the related [Python library](https://github.com/SawdustSoftware/simpleflake).

## Installation

    $ go get -u github.com/cmodk/go-snowflake

## Usage

```go
import (
  "github.com/cmodk/go-snowflake"
)

func main() {
  id, err := snowflake.New() // generates a new ID
  if err != nil {
    snowflake.Parse(id) // parses an ID into its time and sequence components
  }
}
```

You can also customize the ID generation options:
```go
snowflake.SetCustomEpoch(time.Date(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
snowflake.SetCustomPrecision(48)
```
